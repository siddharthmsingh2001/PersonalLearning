- In Java we have 4 main/Primitive data types:
-Unlike python where everything is object even datatypes, in Java we do have primitive data types
->Integral (byte, short, int, long)
->Floating (float, double)
->Char
->Boolean
- Each type differs by size
-> byte takes 1 byte
-> char takes 2 byte
-> int takes 4 byte
-> float takes 4 byte

- Variables are containers in which we store data in Java these data are Primitive data types or objects
- For primitive data types we have:
-> byte b; //Decleration
-> byte b =5; //Initialization with a literal(here 5 is a integer literal: Constants are called as Literals)
